Putting my work into submission instead of merging into master.
Hopefully that doesn't break the submission system or anything.

# testing

I'm testing with my home address.  At the risk of giving something
away though, there are no elections on the horizon.

And Oregon.

Starting with the location of Clojure West, 2017
Pioneer Place, 340 SW Morrison St, Portland, OR 97204

Then moving to Oregon City to have a space in the place.

Oregon City Public Library

# random thoughts

I really appreciate the time-boxing.  Thank you!

# todo

+ The output is *awful*!  Time's up.  :(

+ Smarter address -> ocd would be fun.  I had to keep myself from
  being distracted.

+ Tests.  No tests.  :(
